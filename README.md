# spotify-analysis
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to analyse my Spotify streaming history.

The complete analysis can be found [on my portfolio](https://jvaleroliet.github.io/projects/spotify_data/). The notebook does not include the observations and notes present on the portfolio, as is intended to generalise to your own data.

## How to use
1. Clone the repo on your local machine.
2. Request your data your spotify data on [this link](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/understanding-my-data/).
3. Paste the json files into the *data* folder.
4. Run the notebook with attention! Some changes would be required to plot your own analysis.

Enjoy!
