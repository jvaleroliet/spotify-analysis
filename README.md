# spotify-analysis
This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook used to analyse my Spotify streaming history.

The complete analysis can be found [on my portfolio](https://jvaleroliet.github.io/projects/spotify_data/)

For privacy reasons, I'm not adding the streaming history files in the repo. You can request your spotify data on [this link](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/understanding-my-data/), add the files to the *data* folder, and run the Notebook.

Enjoy!
