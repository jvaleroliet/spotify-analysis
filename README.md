# spotify-analysis
This repo contains the Jupyter Notebook used to analyse my Spotify streaming history.

The complete analysis can be found [on my portfolio](https://jvaleroliet.github.io/projects/spotify_data/). The notebook does not include the observations and notes present on the portfolio, as is intended to generalise to your own data.

For privacy reasons, I'm not adding the streaming history files in the repo. You can request your spotify data on [this link](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/understanding-my-data/), add the files to the *data* folder, and run the Notebook.

Enjoy!
